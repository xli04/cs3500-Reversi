What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation? Did you learn any lessons
from the code given to you, or the updates you had to make for your customers?
    In this experience, I think the design of our previous code is very good, because in the process
of applying the adapter pattern, we did not change any part about functionality. All the changes
we made were to change the constructor of the model from private to protected, and change some
final classes to non-final to ensure that we can use inheritance to better apply the adapter pattern.
I think the most important lesson I learned from this experience is that when programming, especially
when designing programs, donâ€™t just think about making parts run successfully in your own code, but
also consider more general situations. . For example, in the provider's strategy, they use (0, 0, 0)
as a form of expression without valid move. This point may not exist in their coordinate system, but
when I convert this point into my own coordinate, it is indeed a valid point, so in order to figure
out why this error occurred, I spent at least two hours. This is just a small error and the provider
may not be aware of it, but when I use this code actually caused me some trouble when I came across it.
Therefore, in the future of my programming career, I think I will consider my design in a more general way.

What was your experience like with your providers?
    Well, the experience with the providers is pretty great, they always reply to my questions on time,and
will explain why their design is look like this way. meanwhile, when i was confused about their coordinate
system, they do helped me to understand it.
