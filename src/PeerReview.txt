How flexible are the interfaces you were given?
    The interfaces that i was given is pretty flexible, since most of the methods they given share the
same functionality with the current code i have. And the methods in the interface is pretty general
and they are all necessary to support the code like placeTurn or pass and get board etc. And for the view
the provider's view is encapsulated pretty well so that we only need to use a adapter pattern to make
sure their view will work properly with our view and controller.


How capable are the views?
    The provider's view is very capable, their view is a recognizable reversi board and updates correctly.
At the same time, the methods in their view are also very general. All codes related to repaint board can
be called through the update method, which is completely consistent with our design.

How convenient was it to reuse their code?
    For the controller and view, it is pretty convenient since many methods are sharing the same logic.
For the strategy, there is fewer things that can be improved, first, in the AvoidCellsNextToCornersStrategy
the providers are using position(0,0,0) to represents default position which means no valid move, but the
truth is sometimes it works pretty good if this strategy does not return (0,0,0), but since the providers
are using this position as default position, so it may be returned by the method, that is to say, position
(0,0,0) sometime will represent a position that chosen by strategy or a way to show that the the strategy can
not find a position to move. However, our coordinator converting method knows nothing about this, so we have
to add a check before the AvoidCellsNextToCornersStrategy return a position to make sure it will return a valid
position, rather than a position that seems correctly but actually it is invalid.

How cleanly written and well-documented was their code?
    for the view part, the javadoc is pretty straightforward and clear, i can understand their code easily,
but for the model part, i think my providers can make some improvements on their document parts for their coordinator
system like provide a image to show that the points correspond with their coordinators, which is more cleae and easier
for the readers to understand.

If you needed to request changes from them, what were they and why were they needed?
    I found a bug in their code, in their key press listener, there is no check for the game is over, so that
even though the game is over and the user can not select a position, the users can still make a pass since
no position needed for make pass. But since there are no actions allowed after game is over. This is clearly a
bug, there are two solutions, i can add a check inside the features so that only if the game is in process, the
feature will execute the command in to make pass, or inside the key listener, add a check to ensure no actions
allowed after game is over.
